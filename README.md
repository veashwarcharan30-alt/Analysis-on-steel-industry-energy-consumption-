# Analysis-on-steel-industry-energy-consumption-prediction 

Regression Project

Overview: This project focuses on predicting energy usage (kWh) in the steel industry using regression techniques. The dataset includes operational and environmental factors that influence power consumption.

Objective:

To analyze the factors affecting energy consumption.
To build a predictive model for Usage_kWh (Target Variable).
Data: Total records - 35040, variables - 11 Attributes(Features)
